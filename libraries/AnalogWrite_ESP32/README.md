# About
This library provides an analogWrite function, tone and Servo support for ESP32

Licensed under the MIT license.

This is heavily based on library https://github.com/erropix/ESP32_AnalogWrite/tree/master

# Usage

The library will do all the timer setup and channel selection work behind the scene so you don't have to worry about that.

## Fade Example
```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <analogWrite.h>

int step = 1;
int brightness = 0;

void setup() {
}

void loop() {
  brightness += brightStep;
  analogWrite(LED_BUILTIN, brightness);
  
  if ( brightness == 0 || brightness == 255 ) {  
     brightStep = -brightStep;     
  }
  
  delay(10);  
}
```
  
## Default Value Range
Call the analogWrite function like in standard Arduino framework:
```cpp
analogWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 255); // value range 0-255 so 255 = 100%
```

## Timer Resolution
The default timer resolution is set to 13 bits in all the 16 channels, if you want to change that, use the analogWriteResolution function:
```cpp
analogWriteResolution(10); // set resolution to 10 bits for all pins
analogWriteResolution(LED_BUILTIN, 10); // set resolution to 10 bits for LED pin
```
## PWM Frequency
The default PWM frequency is set to 5000 Hz in all the 16 channels, if you want to change that, use the analogWriteFrequency function:
```cpp
analogWriteFrequency(10000); // set frequency to 10 kHz for all pins
analogWriteFrequency(LED_BUILTIN, 10000); // set frequency to 10 kHz for LED pin
```

Please note that both timer resolution and PWM frequency should be calculated to get the expected results, if frequency is not set correctly, the output PWM signal wonâ€™t be as expected, read more about Supported Range of Frequency and Duty Resolution in the official Espressif documentation website.

## Servo
Servo signal is directly set using the following function:
```cpp
analogServo(2, 90); // Sends 90 degrees signal to pin 2 (0 degrees = 600ms 180 degrees = 2400ms at 50Hz)
analogServo(2, 500); // Sends 500ms signal to pin 2 (if second argument > 200 then is converted to ms at 50Hz)
analogServo(2, 4000); // If the second argument is greater or equal to 4000 detaches servo pin, in this case pin 2
```
 ## Tone
Sends tone of a given frequency and duration to a pin:
```cpp
tone(22, 500, 200); // Sends to pin 22 a 500Hz tone during 200ms
tone(23, 1000); // Sends to pin 23 a 1000Hz tone
notone(23); // kill tone in pin 23
```
